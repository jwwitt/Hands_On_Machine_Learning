    "Machine learning can automate tasks to make a program which is much shorter, easier to maintain, and most likely more accurate. In addition, programs built on machine learning can automatically detect changes and make changes to the algorithm. Machine Learning is much easier to scale. In addition, applying ML techniques to dig into large amounts of data can help discover patterns that were not immediately apparent. This is called *data mining*."
